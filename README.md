# Huawei Radio Team Dashboard

## Overview

I developed a dashboard for Huawei's radio team to monitor clients' network performance and adjust parameters based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This project involved the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, with Charts.js API for visualizing charts. PHP was employed for the backend, facilitating server-side functionalities. XAMPP provided a local development environment, and MySQL was used as the relational database management system to efficiently store and manage data.

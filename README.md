# Network Performance Dashboard

## Overview

I developed a dashboard for a telecommunication provider to monitor clients' network performance and adjust parameters based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This project involved the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, with Charts.js API for visualizing charts. PHP was employed for the backend, facilitating server-side functionalities. XAMPP provided a local development environment, and MySQL was used as the relational database management system to efficiently store and manage data.
